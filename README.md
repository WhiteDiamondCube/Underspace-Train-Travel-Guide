# Underspace-Train-Travel-Guide

A clumsily thrown together python script, because i was annoyed by always having to look up and piece together train routes at the wiki page.
This script downloads the wiki page and automatically searches available routes between a given source and destination.
Just input your starting and target train station in the UI and it'll give you the 10 lowest cost routes between these two.

This script is made for Windows.
If you dont have a python interpreter installed, just unzip the zip-file and use the .exe inside it. That SHOULD also work.
I can't guaranty that it works at all on your PC, because as i said: just quickly pieced together without error handling, optimization or anything else

The provided wiki_site.html is the train travel wiki site from underspace.fandom.com. The script uses that as a reference. If you want to update it, just erase it and it'll be downloaded again.
